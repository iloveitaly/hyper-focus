## Next

- [ ] json schema update
- [ ] allow minute granularity for schedule start/end
  - [ ] setup noon-12:30 schedule; setup 5-5:30 schedule
- [ ] do we need `sudo xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine`?
- [ ] swiftformat needs to be updated to play well with swiftlint
- [ ] Would be cool to have a regex match option, not sure how this would fit into the config schema
- [ ] custom redirect page for browsers when blocked, could be a fun way to redirect to quotes or something
- [ ] YouTube video about how it works
- [ ] merge the scripting bridge stuff upstream https://github.com/tingraldi/SwiftScripting/pull/24#pullrequestreview-1173211472

## Future

- [ ] I wonder if there is a tool out there to generate a ui based off a json schema?
- [ ] If there are no events in a certain period of time, we should trigger an action anyway
- [ ] trunk notes: `trunk exec swiftformat -- <arguments>, You can also find the installed binary in ~/.cache/trunk/tools`

## Accessibility

* `sudo hyper-focus` in a terminal has different properties from a sys accessbility perspective
* maybe the symlink stuff has something to do with it? hyper-focus path is symlinked by homebrew
* maybe it's just a system restart because the binary was replaced?
