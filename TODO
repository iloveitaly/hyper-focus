## Next

- [ ] swiftformat needs to be updated to play well with swiftlint
- [ ] YouTube video about how it works
- [ ] https://github.com/tingraldi/SwiftScripting/pull/24#pullrequestreview-1173211472
- [ ] File watching for config changes
- [ ] Allow different schedules on different days
- [ ] Allow schedules to specify pause increments to limit the pauses available on specific schedules
- [ ] all block/allow config should be optional, but something should be required!
- [ ] rate limit pauses
- [ ] cron-like script execution
- [ ] one thing: see if I can manipulate racyast commands from the command line. THis would enable me to modify the onething command. Maybe build this into hyper focus and create a little server to display the one target goal for the day?

## Future

- [ ] I wonder if there is a tool out there to generate a ui based off a json schema?
- [ ] If there are no events in a certain period of time, we should trigger an action anyway
- [ ] swift verison in the repo
- [ ] maybe build a nice little webpage like https://www.homerow.app
